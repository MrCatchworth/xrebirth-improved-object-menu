When this mod is installed, the new menu will open whenever the normal object menu normally would.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Improved Object Menu aims to make it quicker and nicer to get information about objects, without having to descend into other menus so much, and to make you aware of changes in the object's state (so you can &quot;watch&quot; the menu if you like).&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To this end, the menu uses two columns which scroll independently. The categories are set up to (hopefully) make the best use of screen space in most cases. Many items convey more information than the vanilla counterpart, and use colour to make it even more informative, catching your eye on things that need attention.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Also, many items will update(!) frequently, letting you know what's going on. Cargo amounts, crew commands, boarding resistance, hull and shield, etc, are all kept up to date every few seconds.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[h1]Other features[/h1]&#13;&#10; - Smaller font if the menu thinks it's running in a high resolution&#13;&#10; - Most categories are expanded by default (now we have the luxury of double the rows)&#13;&#10; - Use your comm key &quot;C&quot; to comm an NPC if one is selected, or otherwise to comm the object normally&#13;&#10; - Build module display on shipyards (mostly for fun, but maybe this is useful if you have a player shipyard mod? let me know...)" author="MegaJohnny" version="112" date="2018-10-28" lastupdate="1522136439">
