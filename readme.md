# Improved Object Menu
This mod implements a new menu that shows general object info, just like the vanilla object menu, but with several differences and improvements. It aims to replace the vanilla menu eventually, but for now you will be asked to choose between the vanilla and modified menu whenever you would normally open the object menu.

# Usage
Basically the same as the vanilla menu. If you're not using mouse you'll need to use tab to cycle between columns, or the gamepad equivalent.

The details button (hotkey 4) is derived from the current row in the last column you clicked on (or tabbed to).

If you press the comm hotkey, and a crew member is selected, it will initiate comm with that crew member. Otherwise, it will comm the object as normal.
